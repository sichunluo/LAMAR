## Introduction
In this paper, we propose *L*arge l*A*nguage *M*odel *A*ugmented *R*ecommendation (**LAMAR**) framework to address this limitation. Instead of relying solely on LLMs, our framework combines their outputs with traditional recommendation models, leveraging both collaborative and semantic information. We further enhance the recommendation performance through an ensemble of diverse prompts and utilize LLMs to extract side information for augmenting traditional recommendation models.
